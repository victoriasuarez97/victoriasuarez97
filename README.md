# <code>Hello world</code> 🌎

Hi!😊 I'm Vic, and I'm a Front End developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina (yes, we've got mate, Maradona, Messi, Pope Francis and many more). </br>

I started my journey as a developer on 2019 and currently, I specialize on React ⚛️💖 </br>

I'm always willing to learn new things and create cool projects.

## Next Goal

Learn **WebGL**. - Why? I've always wanted to learn how to animate, and what better way to do it than with coding!
